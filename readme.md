Quick and lazy readme to document changes.

    Added where-we-work.html
        Linked where-we-work to contact-us and vice versa
        Added some css elements to custom.css
    Renamed index.html to contact-us.html
    Cleaned up file and folder structure
    Copied images from contact-images folder back to images folder
        *Moving those images to a new folder broke some of the code in my page. I'd recommend copying images if you'd like to move them to a different folder or location to avoid breaking other code.
    Made subtle formatting changes to header and footer links to closer mirror the mockups. I didn't make the changes to Jay's contact-us page. I'd rather not change any of your formatting without you approving the changes first.
